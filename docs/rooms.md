## Notes

Room notes provide a simple chat-style communication board for staff and parents. Notes entered in this area are visible to everyone with access to that room.

You can permanently delete your own notes at any time. 

Admins and managers can delete anyone's notes.

You can search notes by date or content.

## Meal planner

![meal](_media/meal-plan.png ':size=500')

Each room has its own meal plan.
By default, this week's meal plan is displayed. Use navigation buttons to see other weekly plans.

To simplify planning, we have added ability to copy this week's plan into next week. You can also clear all the contents of this week.

Clicking on a meal item will prompt you to delete that item. There is no editing capability, rather, you can just delete an item and add a new one in its place.

To add a new item, click on the + (plus) icon next to the meal type e.g. Breakfast. Select the date, add the name of the food item and save.
